# Maximum depth of a Binary Tree
1. I used simple approach using recursion to traverse first left part then right part and for each step increase the counter by one and take maximum of it.This is because for +1 which count the number of nodes just below of it and max function takes the maximum path.
2. There is another approach using Level Order Traversal,we employ a breadth-first approach. Initialise a queue and push the root node. Traverse through the levels and track the depth by counting the number of levels traversed. At each level pop the nodes and push their left and right children, incrementing the depth counter as we explore.This process continues until all levels are traversed at which point the depth variable holds the maximum depth of the tree.
