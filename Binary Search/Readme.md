# 1. Find Nth root of a number
The primary objective of the Binary Search algorithm is to efficiently determine the appropriate half to eliminate, thereby reducing the search space by half. It does this by determining a specific condition that ensures that the target is not present in that half.
Now, we are not given any sorted array on which we can apply binary search. But, if we observe closely, we can notice that our answer space i.e. [1, n] is sorted. So, we will apply binary search on the answer space.If mid is less than our target number go to right side and if greater go to left side else or mid element is our answer.

# 2.Single Element in a Sorted Array
So firstly we have to play with odd and even length.If any one element appers once and other twice then total length is definitely be odd.So if our mid element is odd and nums[mid]==nums[mid-1] then definitely we have to move left side and if mid is even and nums[mid]==nums[mid+1] then we have also move to the left otherwise right part.If nums[mid]!=nums[mid-1] && nums[mid]!=nums[mid+1] then return mid which is our single element. Also take care of edge case in case of single element and if mid is first or last element of the array.
